Familiarization with OOPs
a. Declare class ‘packet’
b. Within the packet class, declare the following properties
i. 4 bit ‘data’
ii. 2 bit ‘address’
iii. 4x4 bit ‘memory’
c. Within the packet class, declare the following methods
i. A constructor function to initialize the memory locations with values corresponding to the address (eg: mem[0] = 0, mem[1] = 1….)
ii. “WriteMem” %function to write the ‘data’ in the memory address given
iii. “ReadMem” % function to read the ‘data’ from the memory address given and print the values.
iv. “Display” % function to display the current values of data and address
d. Declare two handles pkt_h1 and pkt_h2 for the packet class
e. Accessing members of objects:
i. Create object pkt_h1
ii. Print the statement “ Before writing to memory”
iii. Read and print all the memory contents and include
iv. Assign random values to data and address and write the data in the memory
v. Print the statement “ After writing to memory”
vi. Read and print all the memory contents.
f. Duplicating objects:
i. Display the value of data and address of pkt_h1
ii. Assign pkt_h1 to pkt_h2
iii. Display the values of data and address of pkt_h1 and pkt_h2
iv. Modify the values of data and address using handle pkt_2
v. Display the values of data and address of pkt_h1 and pkt_h2
